// It draws a number, which is in the range 0 to 100 (both 0 and 100 are possible).
// Create a program that draws a number. Then the user has the chance to guess once,
// what the number is. The program should print "The number is lesser",
// "The number is greater" or "Congratulations, your guess is correct!" depending on the number
// the user typed.
